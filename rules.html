    <h1>The Rules</h1>
    <p>Every server has its rules, these are the laws of our land.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Don't be a dick. Any hate speech, racist remarks, or pure disrespect won't be tolerated but telling someone to fuck off is fine.</li>
      <li>No NSFW content.</li>
      <li>All gore will result in a ban without warning.</li>
      <li>Don't post private info/dox. This will result in a ban without warning.</li>
      <li>Keep memes in #shitposting.</li>
      <li>Keep bot commands in #bot. @Sidekick can hang out in #dnd.</li>
      <li>Server issues are dealt with on a case per case basis. The rules are as clear as we can make them, but simply we can't account for every possible situation.</li>
      <li>Don't spam. This includes caps or shitty memes like iFunny. You will be kicked or banned depending on the severity.</li>
      <li>Don't beg for @Trusted, @Janitor, @Moderator, or @Admin.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding the discord or minecraft server please feel free to come talk to any one of the mods.</p>
